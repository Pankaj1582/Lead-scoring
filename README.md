Project Overview
The Lead Scoring Classification project is a comprehensive data science project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer using various machine learning models. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to determine the best model for predicting lead conversion.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of features and identify any imbalances in the target variable (Converted).
Model Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, to predict lead conversion.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for each model to improve accuracy and performance.
Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different models using metrics such as accuracy, AUC-ROC, and cross-validation scores to identify the best-performing model.
Visualization: Plot ROC curves and other visualizations to assess model performance and decision boundaries.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project is the "Leads.csv" file, which contains information about potential customers (leads) and their interactions with a company's marketing and sales team. The key features include demographic information, lead source, lead activity, and various other categorical and numerical attributes.

Data Preprocessing
Missing Values: Handled missing values by filling them with the mode for categorical variables and the median for numerical variables.
Feature Engineering: Combined low-frequency categories into an "Others" category to simplify the model and reduce noise.
Encoding: Applied Label Encoding for binary categorical features and OneHot Encoding for multi-category features to prepare the data for model training.
Normalization: Normalized numerical features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's decision-making process.


Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression:
Objective: To model the probability of lead conversion as a function of the features.
Performance: Achieved a high level of accuracy with cross-validation and GridSearchCV optimization.

Decision Tree Classifier:
Objective: To create a tree-based model that segments the data into distinct regions based on feature values.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explored different tree depths and splitting criteria to optimize performance.

Random Forest Classifier:
Objective: To build an ensemble model using multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
GridSearchCV: Used to identify the best combination of depth, features, and estimators for the model.


Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Evaluated on both training and test datasets to assess model generalization.
AUC-ROC: Plotted ROC curves to compare the true positive rate versus the false positive rate for different models.
Cross-Validation: Performed 9-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and consistency across different subsets of the data.


Key Results
Logistic Regression: Provided a good balance of interpretability and performance, with an AUC-ROC score demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between converted and non-converted leads.
Decision Tree: Showed overfitting on the training set but performed well after hyperparameter tuning.
Random Forest: Outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and AUC-ROC, making it the best model for predicting lead conversion.


Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the process of building and evaluating machine learning models to predict lead conversion. The Random Forest model emerged as the top performer, offering the best balance between accuracy and model robustness. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve marketing strategies and optimize resource allocation for lead conversion.
